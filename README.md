# Build a database driven React App
Overview:
- Putting together the React client code, Node.js server code and Postgres database to build a full stack React application.

Example: https://react-posts-example-client.onrender.com/posts/add

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to create new posts and add them to the page
- 🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to assign a category to each post
- 🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to view all posts added on the page and the category they're in
- 🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to view all posts in a specific category by visiting a dedicated page for that category (Stretch Goal)
- 🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to add new categories (Stretch Goal)

Requirements: 
- Database (Supabase), Server (Express), Client (React) (Made in this order)
- 🎯 Design a database schema with relationships between tables
- 🎯 Create a new application with a React client and an Express server
- 🎯 Seed the database with data. Either run your SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor OR use a seed.js file. (if you use the Supabase editor, save the scripts you run in a file in your project, in case you need to rerun them, or we need to duplicate the project)
- 🎯 Create Express endpoints to handle requests so you can POST and GET the data appropriately for your application
- 🎯 Create multiple pages using react-router-dom:
-   🎯 Create a home page
-   🎯 Create a page to show all the posts and use fetch to call your server to get your data
-   🎯 Create a page where users can create new posts using a form

Stretch Goals:
- 🏹 Allow users to "Like" posts and increase the likes
- 🏹 Allow users to DELETE posts
- 🏹 Allow users to filter posts in a specific category. Use either a query string like /posts?category=education or a dedicated route for the categories at /posts/:categoryName
